I am an aspiring master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk). My current research is centered around Natural Language. 
Apart from AI research, I am enthusiastic about Quantitative Trading and Research.  

In my Blog I will be posting articles on the latest trends in AI I am excited about, my software tutorials I think will be of use to the folks, as well as tools and technology I use.

In my Projects you will find my Pet Projects.

More content is coming soon. Stay tuned.
