I am an aspiring master's student in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk). My current research is centered around Natural Language. 
Apart from AI research, I am enthusiastic about Quantitative Trading and Research.  

I also hold a bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the [Middle East Technical University](https://www.metu.edu.tr) with specialization in Power Systems. I have actually worked in construction as an Electrical Engineer for 3 years. So, I can be considered a "transitioner" to the field of AI / Data Science. 

In my [Blog](https://salkyna.github.io/blog/) I will be posting articles on the latest trends in AI I am excited about, my software tutorials I think will be of use to the folks, as well as tools and technology I use.

In my [Projects](https://salkyna.github.io/projects/) you will find my Pet Projects.

More content is coming soon. Stay tuned.
